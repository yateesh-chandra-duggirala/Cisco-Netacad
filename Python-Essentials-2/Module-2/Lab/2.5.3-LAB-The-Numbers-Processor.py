# User needs to input a line filled with numbers, and to process them easily. 
# Note: the routine input() function, combined together with the int() or float() functions, is unsuitable for this purpose.

# The processing will be extremely easy â€“ we want the numbers entered from the user to be summed.
# Using list comprehension may make the code slimmer. You can do that if you want.
# Also, If the user inputs spaces, it displays Bogus Result, Hence that is also fixed here.

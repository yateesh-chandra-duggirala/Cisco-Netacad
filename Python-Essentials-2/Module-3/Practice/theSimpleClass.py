# Define a simple class
class TheSimplestClass :
    pass

# We have defined a class
# Class is rather poor
# It has neither properties nor activities. It is empty.(That does not matter for now).
# Pass keyword fills the class with nothing. It does not contain any methods or properties.

my_first_object = TheSimplestClass()
# from the above line, my_first_object is the object for the class TheSimplestClass.

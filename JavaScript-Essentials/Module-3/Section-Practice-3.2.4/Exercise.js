// Exercise: Using everything youâ€™ve learned up until this point, write a script that asks a user about the width, height, and length of a box, then calculate and return to the user the volume of this box.

// As an example, a box with width = 20, height = 10, and length = 50 will have a volume of 10000 (omitting units, as they are not relevant in this scenario). 
// For now, assume that the values provided by the user are valid numbers, but if you have any ideas on how, you can try to make this script in such a way that it will be resistant to invalid values.

let width = window.prompt("Enter the Width : ", 0);
let height = window.prompt("Enter the Height : ", 0);
let length = window.prompt("Enter the Length : ", 0);
volume = width * height * length;
alert( volume > 0 ? `The Volume of the Box : ${volume}` : "Invalid Values");
console.log(volume > 0 ? `The Volume of the Box : ${volume}` : "Invalid Values");

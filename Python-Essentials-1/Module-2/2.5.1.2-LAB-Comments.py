Scenario
The code in the editor contains comments. Try to improve it: add or remove comments where you find it appropriate (yes, sometimes removing a comment can make the code more readable), and change variable names where you think this will improve code comprehension.

Given piece of code : 

#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago

a = 2 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour

print("Hours: ", a) #printing the number of hours
# print("Seconds in Hours: ", a * seconds) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

#here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
#this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds in 3 hour

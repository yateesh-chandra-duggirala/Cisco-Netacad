Scenario:

The word Mississippi is also used for a slightly different purpose: to count mississippily.

If you're not familiar with the phrase, we're here to explain to you what it means: it's used to count seconds.

The idea behind it is that adding the word Mississippi to a number when counting seconds aloud makes them sound closer to clock-time, and therefore "one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi" will take approximately an actual three seconds of time! 
It's often used by children playing hide-and-seek to make sure the seeker does an honest count.

Your task is very simple here: 
write a program that uses a for loop to "count mississippily" to five. 
Having counted to five, the program should print to the screen the final message "Ready or not, here I come!"

Expected output:

1 Mississippi
2 Mississippi
3 Mississippi
4 Mississippi
5 Mississippi
Ready or not, here I come!
